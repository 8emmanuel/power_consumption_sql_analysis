This project explores the Power Consumption dataset using PostgreSQL to demonstrate strong SQL querying and analytical skills.
The dataset contains detailed time-series measurements of household electricity usage — including active and reactive power, voltage, current intensity, and energy sub-metering — recorded at minute-level intervals.

The goal of this project was to analyze power usage patterns, identify trends in energy consumption, and extract meaningful insights from structured data using SQL alone.
